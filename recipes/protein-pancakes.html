        <li>75g oats</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tbsp milk (dairy, soya, oat or nut milks all work)</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whizz the banana, oats, eggs, milk, baking powder, cinnamon and protein powder in a blender for 1-2 mins until smooth. Check the oats have broken down, if not, blend for another minute.</li>
        <li>Heat a drizzle of oil in a pan. Pour or ladle in 2-3 rounds of batter, leaving a little space between each to spread.
